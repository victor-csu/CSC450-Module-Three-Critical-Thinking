PROGRAM: Integer Pointers
-	This program collects three integer values as input. Stores the values into three different variables.
    For each variable, it creates an integer pointer to dynamic memory and displays the contents of the variables and pointers.
    The new operator and delete operators are used to manage memory.

BEGIN
    BEGIN
        create a main.cpp file.

        declare a "str_trim" function that takes a string and returns the string with white space removed from both ends. Make sure the initial string is not mutated.
        declare a "get_input" function that prompts a user to enter an integer string and returns a value of the type int.
                The function takes one argument: a string "instruction" to tell the user what to enter.
                Use the "str_trim" function to trim the string and the "int" function to convert it to an integer before returning it.
                Save the final value in a pointer and return it.
    END

    declare a main function to run the program.
    inside the main function:
        - using the "get_input" function collect the user input thrice and save them in different variables.
        - store the value of the pointer variables created above in separate variables.
        - Print out each of the variables above, the value and its pointer.
        - deallocate the pointer variables created using the "delete" keyword.
END
